# 🎨 ColorBliss Website

## About
ColorBliss is a simple yet visually engaging website built to establish an online presence for a creative client. While WordPress was used as a base, I developed custom **CSS styling**, optimized assets in **GIMP**, and ensured a sleek, accessible, and responsive design.

## ✨ Key Features
✅ **Custom CSS Styling**: Header, typography, testimonials, and layout improvements.  
✅ **Optimized Header & Logo**: Reduced spacing and improved alignment.  
✅ **Testimonial Section Enhancements**: New background, border, and typography styling.  
✅ **Mobile-Friendly Adjustments**: Better layout handling on smaller screens.  

## 📂 Project Files
- **`css/custom.css`** → Contains all my CSS modifications.
- **`demo.html`** → A standalone page demonstrating key styling changes.
- **`docs/screenshots/`** → Before/after images showing improvements.
